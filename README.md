# core-notes

This project holds my personal notes taken from various sources. The focus is
on computer science topics.

## Organization

Notes are organized by themes in `notes/`. Each theme has its own sub-folder
and each sub-folder contains a RMarkdown document along with a *compiled*
version of it (named `README.md`) that can be rendered in Github's web
interface. The format of the compiled document is *Github Flavored Markdown*.

## Table of contents

## Errors and feedback

If you found an error and would like to either fix it or communicate it,
please [submit an issue](https://github.com/jeanmathieupotvin/core-notes/issues).
I will gladly answer. Many thanks!
